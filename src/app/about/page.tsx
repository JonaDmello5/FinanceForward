        Our financial calculations are grounded in well-established, industry-standard formulas for accuracy and reliability. For loan calculations (EMI), we use the formula:
      </p>
      <div className="text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 font-mono bg-secondary/50 p-3 rounded-md my-3 overflow-x-auto shadow-inner">
        M = P [ i(1 + i)<sup>n</sup> ] / [ (1 + i)<sup>n</sup> â€“ 1 ]
      </div>
      <p className="text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 text-balance mb-1">where:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 space-y-1 mb-4 pl-4">
        <li>M is the monthly payment,</li>
        <li>P is the principal loan amount,</li>
        <li>i is the monthly interest rate, and</li>
        <li>n is the number of months.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 text-balance mb-3">
        For investment calculations (compound interest), we apply the formula:
      </p>
      <div className="text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 font-mono bg-secondary/50 p-3 rounded-md my-3 overflow-x-auto shadow-inner">
        A = P (1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup>
      </div>
      <p className="text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 text-balance mb-1">where:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 space-y-1 mb-4 pl-4">
        <li>A represents the future value of the investment or loan (including interest),</li>
        <li>P is the principal amount (the initial deposit or loan),</li>
        <li>r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),</li>
        <li>n is the number of times interest is compounded annually, and</li>
        <li>t is the duration of the investment in years.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 text-balance mb-3">
        In retirement planning, we calculate the future value of savings and annuity payments. The future value of savings is derived from the formula:
      </p>
      <div className="text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 font-mono bg-secondary/50 p-3 rounded-md my-3 overflow-x-auto shadow-inner">
        FV = P * (((1 + r)<sup>n</sup> - 1) / r)

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 space-y-1 mb-4 pl-4">
        <li>FV is the future value of the savings,</li>
        <li>P is the periodic payment,</li>
        <li>r is the interest rate per period, and</li>
        <li>n is the number of periods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-md leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 text-balance">
        For annuity calculations, we determine the periodic payments required to reach a desired future value. All calculations are performed client-side to maintain user privacy and ensure fast performance.
