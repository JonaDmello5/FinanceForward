                <p>The calculator performs two main calculations and adds them together:</p>
                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside pl-2 space-y-1">
                  <li><strong>Growth of Current Savings:</strong> It calculates the future value of your existing savings by applying the expected annual return rate over the number of years until you retire.</li>
                  <li><strong>Growth of Future Contributions:</strong> It calculates the future value of all your future monthly contributions, treating them as a growing annuity. This also uses your expected return rate.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The sum of these two values gives you an estimate of your total retirement nest egg.</p>

              <AccordionContent className="text-foreground/80">
                This is the average annual percentage you expect your investments to earn. It's a crucial variable in your retirement plan. For example, a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds might have a historical average return of 5-8% per year. Conservative investments might yield less, while more aggressive strategies might aim for more (with higher risk). It's important to choose a realistic number based on your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

              <AccordionTrigger>Why is starting early so important?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent className="text-foreground/80">
                The power of compound interest means that the longer your money is invested, the more time it has to grow. Even small, regular contributions made early in your career can grow into very large sums over several decades. Use the calculator to see the difference between starting at age 25 versus age 35â€”the results can be dramatic and highlight the importance of time in investing.
